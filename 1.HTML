				 On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate
				with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert
				tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building 
				blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate 
				with your current document look.
				You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text 
				by choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery 
				on the Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other 
				controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look 
				from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly.
